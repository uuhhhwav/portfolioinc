Second Quarter Reflection!
</h1>

<div id="reflection">
Second quarter of Grade 9 was, for lack of a better word, crazy. As I'm writing this, it isn't even done yet, but I can confidently say right now that this quarter was significantly harder than the first. Not just in ICT but for all subjects too. Needless to say, this was a decent quarter overall. My seating arrangement for this quarter helped me gain new friends. However, like I already mentioned, this quarter was way harder school-wise. It's like every subject decided to crank its difficulty up to 11. Though that didn't stop me from having a fun time throughout this quarter. Regarding ICT, I never really knew just how powerful CSS actually is. I still prefer using tables over divs any day, but even with that, things just get so easy with CSS in play. That being said, I'm excited to see what challenges third and fourth quarter will bring upon me. <br><br>
