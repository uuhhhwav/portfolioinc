Marc Marquez is a Spanish Grand Prix motorcycle road racer. Born in Cervera, Catalonia, Spain, he is nicknamed the 'Ant of Cervera' worldwide (due to his height of 5' 7" (1.68m)), and 'el tro de Cervera' in his hometown, meaning the 'Thunder of Cervera'. He is one of the most successful motorcycle racers of all time, with eight Grand Prix World Championships to his name, six of which are in the premier class. He is the most successful Spanish rider in MotoGP to date with 62 wins, most recently the 2024 Australian Grand Prix. From his debut season in the premier class in 2013 up until 2023, Marquez raced for the Repsol Honda Team. In 2024, he raced for Gresini Racing, serving as teammates with his younger brother, Alex Marquez. In 2025, he will race alongside Francesco Bagnaia for the Ducati Lenovo Team. <br><br>
